    "This paper deals with an object sorting problem, generally well known in many machine learning pipelines. For instance, the to k-multi-class classification, ranking documents for information retrieval and multi-object target tracking in computer vision.To solve these problems, algorithms are used that typically require the learning of informative representations of complex high-dimensional data, such as images, prior to sorting and subsequent downstream processing. \n",

    "However, for a downstream sorting problem, it is not possible to optimize it from end to end because the sorting operator is not differentiable with respect to its input. The goal of this paper is to propose a method that makes the sort operator differentiable almost everywhere with respect to the inputs. This proposed method is $\\textbf{NeuralSort}$.

For NeuralSort, we consider other matrix called  unimodal row-stochastic matrix. It is a square matrix with positive real entries, where each row sums to 1 and has a distinct arg max. All permutation matrices are unimodal row-stochastic matrices. \n",
